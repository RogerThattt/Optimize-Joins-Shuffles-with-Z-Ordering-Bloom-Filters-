ðŸ”¹ Z-Ordering for Optimized Data Skipping
Problem:
When filtering data, Databricks must scan many files. Traditional partitioning isn't enough when multiple filter conditions exist.

Solution:
Z-Ordering sorts data across multiple columns at the file level, improving data skipping and reducing scan time.

Example: Optimizing a Customer Data Table
A telecom provider may frequently query customer usage patterns by region and device type. Without Z-Ordering, queries will scan unnecessary files.

python
Copy
Edit
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Read existing table
df = spark.read.table("telecom_usage_data")

# Write optimized data with Z-Ordering
df.write \
   .mode("overwrite") \
   .format("delta") \
   .option("mergeSchema", "true") \
   .option("zorderBy", "region, device_type") \
   .saveAsTable("telecom_usage_data_optimized")
Why this helps:

Improves file pruning â†’ Queries reading region='New York' won't scan the entire dataset.

Reduces shuffle overhead â†’ Only relevant partitions are read.
